# CannonShooter

Cannon Shooter is a prototype of an artillery game used for practice. It utilizes a projectile object, button objects, graphic objects to track the shot, and provides a target to shoot at.

The program will allow the player to shoot until he or she hits the target with the correct angle and velocity. After hitting the target, the program will inform the user how many shots it took to hit the target.

Future improvements may include exiting the tracking loop after the object exits the bounds of the window and allowing the field to be reset to try again without exiting the program.
